# Psychic-Game
  
This is a game wherein the app randomly picks an alphabet, and the player has to guess which letter the app chose. 

* The player gets 5 attempts to guess the alphabet.
* For every correct guess the player 'Wins' tally increments. 
* If the player is unable to guess the correct alphabet within 5 attempts, the Losses tally increments.

Note:
- Guesses Left: Denotes the number of attempts left.
- Your Guesses So Far: Displays the specific letters that the player typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.



Have Fun!
